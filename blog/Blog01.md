## Product Design

| Player Experience and Game POV         | The game will be in a **first-person perspective**. The player will explore a magical world filled with mystical creatures and ancient ruins while uncovering the truth behind their uploaded consciousness.                  |
| Visual and Audio Style | Magical and surreal â€” vibrant colors, glowing elements, and atmospheric sounds with soft magical chimes. As the player progresses, the environment gradually shifts to a more realistic setting with muted tones and subtle visual glitches, accompanied by darker, more haunting music to reflect the growing tension and awareness. |
| Game World Fiction | The player starts in a magical realm and will later progress to a glitched reality and a chaotic dystopia, as their awareness of the reality of their existence gradually increases.|
| Platform(s), Technology, and Scope (brief) | PC and Arcade, 3D using Unity Editor, created with a focus on exploration, mystery, and puzzle-solving. |
